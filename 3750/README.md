CPSC 3750 Solo Project 2

Uses HTML + CSS for page display, JavaScript for frontend handling and PHP for backend handling
Hosted entirely on local machine via localhost (not deployed on Netlify or any shared hosting)

In this updated take on Solo Project 1, more responsibilities are on the server than the client.
The JavaScript helps convert the static HTML with dynamic elements which it calls for using the backend.
The PHP takes JavaScript's requests, computes them, and returns the data.

The JSON file functions as permanent storage to keep the server stateless but up to date with user interactions
Each user action calls the backend to review the list and perform any necessary actions.

Installation Instructions:
In XAMPP's htdocs folder, create a folder titled 'crud_project_2' such that you now have a directory that looks like this: ...\xampp\htdocs\crud_project_2

Copy all files downloaded from my GitHub repository to your new 'crud_project_2' file

After starting Apache on your XAMPP application, copy and paste the following URL into your web browser of choice: http://localhost/crud_project_2/

This will navigate you to my web application
